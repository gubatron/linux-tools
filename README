Sometimes you want linux commands to be a little easier to use, or sometimes what you need to do is not there.
The linux way for me is to code these things whether on bash or on python.

I'm aware that some of these commands already exist, but fuck it sometimes it is better to have tools you understand better.

All of the commands are available under the MIT License.

Enjoy.

pskill - Because pkill doesn't work the way I want to.
connections - See how many ESTABLISHED connections you have.
hungry - See which are the most resource hungry process.
md5 - Because md5sum is too long.
most_connections - See which IP addresses are connecting the most.
netspeed - See the transfer rates on your network adapter live.
purgeTildes - Get rid of all the left over files emacs can leave recursively from where you stand
rs - don't do 'sudo /etc/init.d/service restart', just do 'rs service'
