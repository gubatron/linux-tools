Sometimes you want linux commands to be a little easier to use, or sometimes what you need to do is not there.
The linux way for me is to code these things wether on bash or on python.

I'm aware that some of these commands already exist, but fuck it. I like them better my way and you may like my way better too.

All of the commands are available under the MIT License.

Enjoy.
