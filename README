Sometimes you want linux commands to be a little easier to use, or sometimes what you need to do is not there.
The linux way for me is to code these things whether on bash or on python.

I'm aware that some of these commands already exist, but fuck it sometimes it is better to have tools you understand better.

All of the commands are available under the MIT License.

Enjoy.
